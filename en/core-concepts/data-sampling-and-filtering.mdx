## General Data Sampling Principle

Jira Metrics Plugin (JMP) uses a unified approach to data sampling for all reports. The plugin gets your board settings and uses them to create a sample of tasks for analysis. By default, JMP includes all tasks that have ever been on the board, in all columns and swimlanes.

## Filtering Tools

JMP offers several tools to refine your sample:

### Select Swimlanes

Allows you to choose specific swimlanes for analysis, helping you focus on certain groups of tasks.

### Quick Filters

JMP automatically adds all quick filters from your board, allowing you to use them for additional task filtering. For example, you can use a quick filter to select tasks for a specific team.

### Timeframe

Lets you specify a time period for analysis using "from" and "to" fields. This helps you focus on a specific time range.

### Select Columns

Used to choose columns for calculating cycle time. In "Activity" filtering mode, this parameter also affects task filtering - only tasks that were active in the selected columns are shown.

### Filtering Mode

Determines how tasks are filtered. Two modes are available: "Activity" and "Completion". You can find a detailed description of these modes in the [Filtering Modes](/en/docs/core-concepts/filtering-modes) article.

### Completion Columns

This parameter is only active in "Completion" filtering mode. It allows you to specify which columns, when passed through, mark a task as completed.

## How It All Works Together

1. JMP first gets all tasks from the board.
2. It applies filtering by selected swimlanes (Select Swimlanes).
3. It applies selected quick filters (Quick Filters).
4. Then it applies the time filter (Timeframe).
5. It applies column filtering depending on the chosen filtering mode (Filtering Mode).
6. If "Columns" mode is selected, it considers Completion Columns.

## Usage Example

Let's say you want to analyze a specific team's work over the last month. Here's how you can use the filters:

1. Choose the swimlane that matches your team's task type.
2. Use the "Team Alpha" quick filter (if you have such a filter on your board).
3. Set the Timeframe to the last month.
4. In Select Columns, choose the columns you want to analyze for task time spent. This will determine which stages of the workflow will be considered when calculating metrics.
5. Choose the appropriate filtering mode (Activity or Completion).

## Usage Recommendations

- Start with a broad sample, gradually narrowing it down using filters for more detailed analysis.
- Experiment with different filter combinations to get the most useful data for you.
- Use quick filters to quickly switch between different sets of tasks, for example, between different teams or types of work.
- Remember that choosing a filtering mode can significantly affect the analysis results. Make sure you understand the difference between "Activity" and "Completion" modes.

Proper use of filters will allow you to get exactly the data you need for effective analysis and improvement of your work processes.
