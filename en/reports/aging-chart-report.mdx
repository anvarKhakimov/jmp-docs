## Overview

The Aging Chart is a visual tool for analyzing the execution time of tasks currently in progress. This report helps quickly assess the distribution of tasks over time and identify potential problems or bottlenecks in the delivery process.

## Chart Structure

- **X-axis**: Jira board columns
- **Y-axis**: Time tasks have accumulated in selected columns (in days)

Each task is represented by a dot on the chart:
- The higher the dot, the longer the task has been in progress.
- If several tasks have approximately the same execution time, they are grouped into a common dot with an indication of their number.

## Interactive Elements

When hovering over a dot, a tooltip appears with the following information:
- Link to the task in Jira
- Accumulated time in selected columns

## Statistics Calculation (Percentiles)

Statistics are calculated based on all tasks in the sample, including historical data. Applied filters, selected dates, swimlanes, and columns are taken into account.

Users can choose how to calculate statistics:
- **All columns**: Considers time in all selected columns.
- **Last Column**: Considers time in all selected columns except the last one (usually the "Done" column).

## Color Coding

Color coding of tasks is set up based on calculated percentiles:

When selecting one percentile (e.g., 50%):
- **Green**: Tasks that have accumulated less time than the 50th percentile.
- **Red**: Tasks that have accumulated more time than the 50th percentile.

When selecting two percentiles (e.g., 50% and 85%):
- **Green**: Tasks that have accumulated less time than the 50th percentile.
- **Orange**: Tasks between the 50th and 85th percentiles.
- **Red**: Tasks that have accumulated more time than the 85th percentile.

It's important to note that the height of colored blocks differs for each column. This is because percentiles are calculated separately for each column, taking into account accumulated time in previous columns.

## Additional Features

- **Show calculation details**: Allows you to see the raw data used for calculations.

## Interpreting Results

1. **Identifying anomalies**: Tasks significantly higher than others may require special attention.

2. **Distribution analysis**: Evaluate how tasks are distributed over time in different columns. This can indicate bottlenecks in the process.

3. **Early problem detection**: Pay attention to tasks in the red zone in initial columns. This may signal potential problems in early stages.

4. **Process efficiency assessment**: A large number of tasks in the upper part of the chart may indicate a need for process optimization.

## Usage Recommendations

1. **Regular monitoring**: Use the Aging Chart for daily or weekly reviews of current task status.

2. **Adjusting percentiles**: Experiment with different percentile values for a better understanding of task distribution.

3. **Combining with other metrics**: Use the Aging Chart along with other reports, such as Cycle Time, to get a complete picture of process efficiency.

4. **Focus on anomalies**: Pay special attention to tasks that significantly deviate from the general distribution.

## Conclusion

The Aging Chart is a powerful tool for visualizing the current state of tasks and identifying potential problems in the work process. Proper use of this report will help you quickly respond to deviations and maintain the efficiency of your workflow.
