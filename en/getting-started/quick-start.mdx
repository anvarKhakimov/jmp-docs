Choose the report you're interested in by clicking on the corresponding tab.

## Setting Up Filters

Before generating a report, you can set up filters:

2. Specify the desired board columns.
3. If necessary, choose specific swimlanes or quick filters.

## Analyzing Data

Study the generated report. Pay attention to:
